						<h1>Hero Map - World Exploration</h1>
						<p>Hero Map took several months to develop, and is most likely my largest free-time project so far. The idea of a real world map that you slowly reveal as you phisically walk around was too complex to be executed during a hackathon so I decided to properly build it myself over a longer period.</p>

						<p>The app uses Apache Cordova framework and is built entirely using JavaScript and web technologies. <br />Currently, the Android version of the game can be found in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dalimil.heromap">Google Play Store</a>.<br />You might also want to check out <a href="https://dalimil.github.io/HeroMap/">Hero Map landing page</a>.</p>

						<p>Do you love traveling and visiting other countries? Or simply going on hikes and exploring your neighborhood? <br />This app gives you a map that is blank first, but becomes more complete as you walk. Now you can keep track of your weekend backpacking trips or daily walks, and most of all, have fun!

						<h1>HackTrain 3.0 - TrainCrowd</h1>
						<p>During the HackTrain 3.0 hackathon, we built a data visualisation tool using the Travel for London dataset of tram line occupancies. It reconstructs the tram lines on a map and shows an animation of the whole system.<br />

					<!-- Skyscanner Roundtrip App -->
					<section id="skyscanner-roundtrip" class="project-details">
						<h1>Skyscanner Roundtrip App</h1>
						<p>At HackUPC 2016 we built a mobile app that allows you to plan a multi-day trip to visit several cities, and finds the cheapest flight combinations by using the <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net"><strong>Skyscanner</strong></a> API.
						</p>

						<p>When you go on a trip around Europe and want to see multiple cities, it's difficult to predict which combination of flights would produce the cheapest option and which days are most suitable for travel. With our mobile app, all you need to do is to input all the cities you want to visit, and we'll do all the hard trip planning for you.</p>

						<p>During the hackathon we also built a Twilio-powered service that sends you a map of your surrounding area after receiving an SMS with your geo-coordinates. We implemented all data exchange on top of standard SMS service so it works even when you are offline and have no Wi-Fi or mobile data.

						<h1>Mosaic - Chrome App</h1>
						<p><strong>Mosaic</strong> is a Chrome app that creates a fully customizable split-screen browser layout. It was built during the Facebook London Hackathon (March 2016) and is now available in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mosaic/jjkdinonnkgnnapdocolkjfnabepfkmj">Chrome Web Store</a>.</p>
						<p>Users have the ability to add, delete, resize and drag &amp; drop webpage views. <br />
						User session is stored in Google Cloud so that reopening the app always restores the last opened web pages.</p>
						<span class="image fit basic-border"><img src="%PUBLIC_URL%/images/mosaic-chrome-app.jpg" alt="Mosaic - Chrome App - Dalimil Hajek"></span>
						<p>
						The representation of the layout is implemented as a binary tree. <br />
						All operations (such as resizing, adding, deleting or moving windows) are implemented as functions that modify this tree and often involve recursive traversals. For example, action 'resetLayout' is a function that rebuilds the whole tree using breadth first search and adding new nodes/views layer by layer.<br />

					<!-- Smart Data Hack 2016 -->
					<section id="smart-data-hack" class="project-details">
						<h1>Smart Data Hack 2016</h1>
						<p>During a 5-day long hackathon in Edinburgh (Feb 2016) we built a visualization tool for the history of additions and changes in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org"><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong></a>. Our project uses latest OSM data (obtained dynamically via an API) to display history of contributions to the map in a given area. </p>
						<p>
						Video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzWmvNUBAPs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzWmvNUBAPs</a><br />
						Everything is rendered on top of current OpenStreetMap tiles. We allow the user to click through and view changes done in a given time period and we also provide a 'play button' to show an animation.
						</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="%PUBLIC_URL%/images/smart-data-hack.jpg" alt="Smart Data Hack 2016 - Dalimil Hajek"></span>
						<p>
						In addition to that, we extended our map by creating a layer with available water points in Africa. This allows anybody to easily find close water sources. Although we focused on water wells, this idea can be easily extended to show any kind of information recorded in OSM data, such as hospitals, landmarks, railways,...<br />

					<!-- Facebook friends graph -->
					<section id="fb-friends-graph" class="project-details">
						<h1>Network Graph of my Facebook Friends</h1>
						<p>
						I thought it would be cool to visualize a graph of people who are my friends on Facebook. Nodes would represent people, with an edge between two nodes whenever those two people were friends.
						</p>
						<p>
						First of all, I had to get the data set - I needed to get the 'friend list' of every user that I am friends with. Unfortunately, Facebook API does not support this. It did support it to some extent in the past (API v1.0) but due to privacy concerns this functionality has been removed (since API v2.0 - April 2014). <br />
						The only option left was to write a script that would log in to Facebook and crawl the network graph. 
						</p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="%PUBLIC_URL%/images/gephi-yifan-hu.jpg" alt="Yifan Hu - Gephi - Dalimil Hajek"></span>
						<p>
						The toughest problem was to get a list of friends for a single user - Do you know how Facebook only shows you the first 20 friends when you visit somebody's profile? How you need to scroll down and wait until Facebook asynchronously pulls more friend profiles in the background? That was challenging to do in code...
						</p>
						<p>
						When I finally had the whole graph of my Facebook friends, I produced a <strong>DOT language</strong> file as output. I then used <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/"><strong>Graphviz</strong></a> to visualize the graph, but instead of using <strong>dot</strong>, the default graph layout mode (which works particularly well for hierarchical graphs), I used <strong>circo</strong>. Circo is a graph layout program (still part of the Graphviz package) for circular layouts. It identifies biconnected components and draws the nodes of each component on a separate circle. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by placing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible.
						</p>
						<div class="flex-row uniform">
							<div><span class="image fit dashed-border"><img src="%PUBLIC_URL%/images/facebook-graph-full.jpg" alt="Facebook Graph - Dalimil Hajek"></span></div>
							<div><span class="image fit dashed-border"><img src="%PUBLIC_URL%/images/facebook-graph-full-with-images.jpg" alt="Facebook Friends Graph - Dalimil Hajek"></span></div>
						</div>
						<p>
						I was blown away by the results! The graph very clearly showed groups of people that had strong connections among them (connection = 'be friends with'), such as people from my secondary school, people who are part of the same university society etc. <br />
						It was very interesting to find these patterns only by looking at the connections between my friends. In other words, the clusters of nodes could be very well mapped to real life social groups. Another interesting observation is that even if you keep your friend list private (= red dots), you can be easily placed into a 'group' based on the connections that your friends reveal.
						</p>
						<p>
						Finally, I experimented with another graph drawing tool - <a href="https://gephi.org/"><strong>Gephi</strong></a>. It implements several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing"><strong>force-directed layout algorithms</strong></a>, such as Fruchterman-Reingold, but I found the results less appealing (in terms of their layout) than those generated by Graphviz. See for yourself...

						<h1>Hack-Cambridge Hackathon</h1>
						<p><strong>Hack-Cambridge</strong> was a massive student hackathon with almost 400 participants. It was organized by the University of Cambridge in January 2016.

						<p>
						Our team of four people decided to tackle the <a href="https://www.thales-esecurity.com/"><strong>Thales</strong></a> Security Challenge, which was to create an innovative security solution using today's technology.

						<p>The aim of my <strong>Facebook 2015+1</strong> project was to create 2015+1 Facebook posts. Each post shows a single number from 0 to 2015 (and the numbers are obviously in sorted order). </p>
						<p>
						At first, it seemed that the most straightforward solution would be to use Facebookâ€™s Graph API Explorer or perhaps to obtain the Access Token via a custom-made Facebook application. However, when using the Facebook API you are limited to about 10 posts per day. Clearly, this wasnâ€™t the way to accomplish the task. </p>

						</div>

						What I eventually did was to programmatically imitate a real user signing into Facebook and posting posts by sending HTTP requests in a similar way a web browser does. Still, there were some more issues such as Facebookâ€™s spam filters or posts not showing in the correct order. These have all been dealt with. <em>Tadaaa...</em><br />
