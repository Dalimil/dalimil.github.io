	    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Dalimil/Skyscanner-Hackday">Skyscanner &amp; Make it Social - HACKDAY</a></h3>
	    <p>This was a weekend hackathon that took place on the 3-4th October in Edinburgh. The goal was to build a web application that would use both <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net">Skyscanner</a> API and <a href="https://makeitsocial.com">Make it Social</a> API. Our team (me and Miguel Jaques, also an Edinburgh student) won the first prize. We built an app that allowed groups of people coming from different countries to a single destination find optimal flights with similar arrival times. Find <a href="https://github.com/Dalimil/Skyscanner-Hackday">more on GitHub</a>.

		    <p>My first Android app. It was my Informatics coursework at my secondary school in Prague. The app is in Czech and is used by students who want to see changes in their timetable, daily lunch menu of the school's cafeteria, and other school-related information. They may also choose to be notified about these changes.<br />

	    <h3>Facebook 2015+1</h3>
		    <p>The aim of my <strong>Facebook 2015+1</strong> project was to create 2015+1 Facebook posts. Each post shows a single number from 0 to 2015 (and the numbers are obviously in sorted order). <br />
		    The solution to the task turned out to be quite tricky. Nevertheless, I accomplished it, with my program taking about an hour to produce those 2016 posts.
		    <div style="text-align: center;">
		    <iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLEuyY9VBaU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		    </div>
		    At first, it seemed that the most straightforward solution would be to use Facebook’s Graph API Explorer or perhaps to obtain the Access Token via a custom-made Facebook application. However, when using the Facebook API you are limited to about 10 posts per day. Clearly, this wasn’t the way to accomplish the task. <br />
			What I eventually did was to programmatically imitate a real user signing into Facebook and posting posts by sending HTTP requests in a similar way a web browser does. Still, there were some more issues such as Facebook’s spam filters or also the posts not being in the correct order. These have all been dealt with. <em>Tadaaa...</em>
