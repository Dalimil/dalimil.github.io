						<h1>Network Graph of my Facebook Friends</h1>
						<p>
						I thought it would be cool to visualize a graph of people who are my friends on Facebook. Nodes would represent people, with an edge between two nodes whenever those two people were friends.
						</p>
						<p>
						First of all, I had to get the data set - I needed to get the 'friend list' of every user that I am friends with. Unfortunately, Facebook API does not support this. I've read that it did support it to some extent in the past (API v1.0) but due to privacy concerns this functionality has been removed (since API v2.0 - April 2014). 
						</p>
						<p>
						The only option left was to write a script that would log in to Facebook and crawl the network graph. 
						</p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/gephi-yifan-hu.jpg" alt="Yifan Hu - Gephi - Dalimil Hajek"></span>
						<p>
						Sure, I have already done something similar before (see my <a href="#facebook-2015" class="scrolldown">"Facebook 2015+1" project</a>, where I programmatically posted over two thousand Facebook posts), but this got much more complicated. The recursive nature of the search was not an issue at all (I was only interested in 'friends of my friends' anyway - otherwise the graph would become enormous). The problem was to get a 'friend list' of a single user.
						</p>
						<p>
						Do you know how Facebook only shows you the first 20 friends when you visit somebody's profile? How you need to scroll down and wait until Facebook asynchronously pulls more friend profiles in the background? <br />
						Well, that was the real challenge to do in my code.
						</p>
						<p>
						And when I was almost done, my little bot started receiving 'Security Check Required'. <br />
						I am not going to say how I got past that, but it was most amusing when I figured it out.<br />
						To make the graph a bit more fancy, I also pulled my friends' profile images and set them as nodes.
						</p>
						<p>
						When I finally had the whole graph of my Facebook friends, I produced a <strong>DOT language</strong> file as output. I then used <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/"><strong>Graphviz</strong></a> to visualize the graph, but instead of using <strong>dot</strong>, the default graph layout mode (which works particularly well for hierarchical graphs), I used <strong>circo</strong>. Circo is a graph layout program (still part of the Graphviz package) for circular layouts. It identifies biconnected components and draws the nodes of each component on a separate circle. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by placing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible.
						</p>

						</div><p><i>Light blue dot = me; Red dots = people with private friend list; Purple dots = everyone else</i></p>
						<p>
						I was blown away by the results! The graph very clearly showed groups of people that had strong connections among them (connection = 'be friends with'), such as people from my secondary school, people who are part of the same university society etc. <br />
						It was very interesting to find these patterns only by looking at the connections between my friends. In other words, the clusters of nodes could be very well mapped to real life social groups. Another interesting observation is that even if you keep your friend list private, you can be easily placed into a 'group' based on the connections that your friends reveal.
						</p>
						<p>
						Finally, I experimented with another graph drawing tool - <a href="https://gephi.org/"><strong>Gephi</strong></a>. It implements several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing"><strong>force-directed layout algorithms</strong></a>, such as Fruchterman-Reingold, but I found the results less appealing (in terms of their layout) than those generated by Graphviz. See for yourself...

					<!-- JP Morgan - Code for Good 2015 -->
					<section id="jpmorgan-hackathon" class="project-details">
						<p class="project-date">November 2015</p>
						<h1>JPMorgan Chase - 'Code for Good' 2015 - Hackathon</h1>
						<p><strong>Code for Good</strong> was a weekend hackathon in Glasgow (7-8th Nov 2015) organised by <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com"><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong></a>.<br />There were 12 teams with 5 people each (mostly university students). Three non-profit organizations â€” <a href="https://www.pancanscot.org/"><strong>Pancreatic Cancer Scotland</strong></a>, <a href="http://gwob.org/"><strong>Geeks Without Bounds</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.urbanroots.org.uk/"><strong>Urban Roots</strong></a> â€” presented challenges that they were facing. Four teams were assigned to each organization and their task was to develop innovative technology solution for the problem that the given organization was facing â€” in just 24 hours. </p>
						<div class="row 25% uniform">
						<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="images/code-for-good-team-wide.jpg" alt="Dalimil Hajek - Code for Good - team"></span></div>

						</div><br />
						<p>
						My team (consisting of me and 4 other Edinburgh students) developed a web application for Urban Roots. We made it possible for volunteers to sign up through the website, choose projects that they want to take part in, and see an embedded Google Map with all their current projects.
						</p>
						<p>
						At the same time, we built an Android app that provided similar functionality to the website, but also allowed anyone to take a photo with their phone and thus report vandalism or any other issue seen in public places (Urban Roots made a request for this feature).
						</p>

						</div><br />
						<p>
						In addition, we created an admin section (on the website) where anyone from Urban Roots could easily manage existing projects, get in touch with volunteers, and also see a list of reported issues.
						</p>
						<p>
						My team won the first stage, where each non-profit organization selected a team that came up with the best solution for their challenge. And after that, when each of the three winning teams presented their projects to a different set of judges (yes, we did the same presentation twice) we were selected as the best team overall and thus we became the winners of the entire hackathon. :-) <br />

					<!-- Skyscanner and Make it Social Hackathon -->

						<p class="project-date">October 2015</p>
						<h1>'Skyscanner &amp; Make it Social' Hackday 2015</h1>
						<p>This was a weekend hackathon that took place on the 3-4th October 2015 in Edinburgh. The goal was to build a web application that would use both <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net"><strong>Skyscanner</strong></a> API and <a href="https://makeitsocial.com"><strong>Make it Social</strong></a> API.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/skyscanner-hackathon.jpg" alt="Skyscanner + Make it Social - HACKDAY"></span>
						<p>Our team (me and Miguel Jaques, also an Edinburgh student) won the first prize. <br />We built an app that allowed groups of people coming from different countries to a single destination find optimal flights with similar arrival times. <br />

					<!-- Facebook 2015+1 project -->
					<section id="facebook-2015" class="project-details">
						<p class="project-date">August 2015</p>
						<h1>Facebook 2015+1</h1>
						<p>The aim of my <strong>Facebook 2015+1</strong> project was to create 2015+1 Facebook posts. Each post shows a single number from 0 to 2015 (and the numbers are obviously in sorted order). <br />
						The solution to the task turned out to be quite tricky. Nevertheless, I accomplished it, with my program taking about an hour to produce those 2016 posts.</p>
						<div class="row 25% uniform">
						<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dalimil-hajek-facebook-1.png" alt="Dalimil Hajek - Facebook 2015+1"></span></div>
						<div class="6u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dalimil-hajek-facebook-2.png" alt="Dalimil Hajek - Facebook 2015+1 project"></span></div>
						</div><br />
						<p>
						At first, it seemed that the most straightforward solution would be to use Facebookâ€™s Graph API Explorer or perhaps to obtain the Access Token via a custom-made Facebook application. However, when using the Facebook API you are limited to about 10 posts per day. Clearly, this wasnâ€™t the way to accomplish the task. </p>
						<p>
						What I eventually did was to programmatically imitate a real user signing into Facebook and posting posts by sending HTTP requests in a similar way a web browser does. Still, there were some more issues such as Facebookâ€™s spam filters or also the posts not being in the correct order. These have all been dealt with. <em>Tadaaa...</em>

						<p>My first Android app. It was my Informatics coursework at my secondary school in Prague. The app is in Czech (as well as the GitHub readme file and comments in the code - sorry I was forced to do this) and is used by students who want to see changes in their timetable, daily lunch menu of the school's cafeteria, and other school-related information.
