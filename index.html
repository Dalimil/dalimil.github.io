						<h1>Mosaic - Chrome App</h1>
						<p><strong>Mosaic</strong> is a Chrome app that was built during the Facebook London Hackathon (12-13th March 2016) and is now available in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mosaic/jjkdinonnkgnnapdocolkjfnabepfkmj">Chrome Web Store</a>.</p>
						<p>Mosaic creates an innovative window layout for the browser using multiple web pages in a single window view rather than many individual tabs. Users have the ability to add, delete, resize and drag &amp; drop webpage views. <br />
						User session is stored in Google Cloud so that reopening the app always restores the last opened web pages.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mosaic-chrome-app.jpg" alt="Mosaic - Chrome App - Dalimil Hajek"></span>
						<p>
						The representation of the layout is implemented as a binary tree. <br />
						All operations (such as resizing, adding, deleting or moving windows) are implemented as functions that modify this tree and often involve recursive traversals. For example, action 'resetLayout' is a function that rebuilds the whole tree using breadth first search and adding new nodes/views layer by layer.<br />

						<h1>Smart Data Hack 2016</h1>
						<p><strong>Smart Data Hack</strong> was a 5-day long hackathon in Edinburgh (15-19th Feb 2016). The aim was to do something innovative with existing data.</p>
						<p>
						We built a visualization tool for the history of additions and changes in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org"><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong></a>. Our project uses latest OSM data (obtained dynamically via an API) to display history of contributions to the map in a given area. <br />
						Everything is rendered on top of current OpenStreetMap tiles. We allow the user to click through and view changes done in a given time period and we also provide a 'play button' to show an animation.
						</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/smart-data-hack.jpg" alt="Smart Data Hack 2016 - Dalimil Hajek"></span>
						<p>
						In addition to that, we extended our map by creating a layer with available water points in Africa. This allows anybody to easily find close water sources. Although we focused on water wells, this idea can be easily extended to show any kind of information recorded in OSM data, such as hospitals, landmarks, railways,...<br />

						<h1>Hack-Cambridge Hackathon</h1>
						<p><strong>Hack-Cambridge</strong> was a massive student hackathon with almost 400 participants. It was organized by the University of Cambridge on the 30-31st January 2016. Several companies presented their challenges, often based on their APIs or product, but people were free to work on something else as well. </p>
						<p>
						Our team of four people decided to tackle the <a href="https://www.thales-esecurity.com/"><strong>Thales</strong></a> Security Challenge, which was to create an innovative security solution using today's technology. After 24 hours of coding and one hour of demoing, we successfully became the winners of the challenge.</p>

					<section id="fb-friends-graph" class="project-details">

						<h1>Network Graph of my Facebook Friends</h1>
						<p>
						I thought it would be cool to visualize a graph of people who are my friends on Facebook. Nodes would represent people, with an edge between two nodes whenever those two people were friends.
						</p>
						<p>
						First of all, I had to get the data set - I needed to get the 'friend list' of every user that I am friends with. Unfortunately, Facebook API does not support this. It did support it to some extent in the past (API v1.0) but due to privacy concerns this functionality has been removed (since API v2.0 - April 2014). 
						</p>
						<p>
						The only option left was to write a script that would log in to Facebook and crawl the network graph. 
						</p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/gephi-yifan-hu.jpg" alt="Yifan Hu - Gephi - Dalimil Hajek"></span>
						<p>
						Sure, I have already done something similar before (see my <a href="#facebook-2015" class="scrolldown">"Facebook 2015+1" project</a>, where I programmatically posted over two thousand Facebook posts), but this got much more complicated. The recursive nature of the search was not an issue at all (I was only interested in 'friends of my friends' anyway - otherwise the graph would become enormous). The problem was to get a 'friend list' of a single user.
						</p>
						<p>
						Do you know how Facebook only shows you the first 20 friends when you visit somebody's profile? How you need to scroll down and wait until Facebook asynchronously pulls more friend profiles in the background? <br />
						Well, that was the real challenge to do in my code.
						</p>
						<p>
						When I finally had the whole graph of my Facebook friends, I produced a <strong>DOT language</strong> file as output. I then used <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/"><strong>Graphviz</strong></a> to visualize the graph, but instead of using <strong>dot</strong>, the default graph layout mode (which works particularly well for hierarchical graphs), I used <strong>circo</strong>. Circo is a graph layout program (still part of the Graphviz package) for circular layouts. It identifies biconnected components and draws the nodes of each component on a separate circle. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by placing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible.
						</p>

						</div><p><i>Light blue dot = me; Red dots = people with private friend list; Purple dots = everyone else</i></p>
						<p>
						I was blown away by the results! The graph very clearly showed groups of people that had strong connections among them (connection = 'be friends with'), such as people from my secondary school, people who are part of the same university society etc. <br />
						It was very interesting to find these patterns only by looking at the connections between my friends. In other words, the clusters of nodes could be very well mapped to real life social groups. Another interesting observation is that even if you keep your friend list private, you can be easily placed into a 'group' based on the connections that your friends reveal.
						</p>
						<p>
						Finally, I experimented with another graph drawing tool - <a href="https://gephi.org/"><strong>Gephi</strong></a>. It implements several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing"><strong>force-directed layout algorithms</strong></a>, such as Fruchterman-Reingold, but I found the results less appealing (in terms of their layout) than those generated by Graphviz. See for yourself...

						<h1>JPMorgan Chase - 'Code for Good' 2015 - Hackathon</h1>
						<p><strong>Code for Good</strong> was a weekend hackathon in Glasgow (7-8th Nov 2015) organised by <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com"><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong></a>.<br />There were 12 teams with 5 people each (mostly university students). Three non-profit organizations â€” <a href="https://www.pancanscot.org/"><strong>Pancreatic Cancer Scotland</strong></a>, <a href="http://gwob.org/"><strong>Geeks Without Bounds</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.urbanroots.org.uk/"><strong>Urban Roots</strong></a> â€” presented challenges that they were facing. Four teams were assigned to each organization and their task was to develop innovative technology solution for the problem that the given organization was facing â€” in just 24 hours. </p>

						</div><br />
						<p>
						My team (consisting of me and 4 other Edinburgh students) developed a web application for Urban Roots. We made it possible for volunteers to sign up through the website, choose projects that they want to take part in, and see an embedded Google Map with all their current projects. <br />
						We also made an Android app that provided similar functionality but also allowed anyone to report vandalism by simply taking a photo.

						<p>
						In addition, we created an admin section (on the website) where anyone from Urban Roots could easily manage existing projects, get in touch with volunteers, and also see a list of reported issues.
						</p>
						<p>
						At the end of the hackathon, our team won the first prize.<br />

						<h1>'Skyscanner &amp; Make it Social' Hackday 2015</h1>
						<p>This was a weekend hackathon that took place on the 3-4th October 2015 in Edinburgh.

					<section id="facebook-2015" class="project-details">
						<p class="project-date">August 2015</p>
						<h1>Facebook 2015+1</h1>
						<p>The aim of my <strong>Facebook 2015+1</strong> project was to create 2015+1 Facebook posts. Each post shows a single number from 0 to 2015 (and the numbers are obviously in sorted order). </p>
						<p>
						At first, it seemed that the most straightforward solution would be to use Facebookâ€™s Graph API Explorer or perhaps to obtain the Access Token via a custom-made Facebook application. However, when using the Facebook API you are limited to about 10 posts per day. Clearly, this wasnâ€™t the way to accomplish the task. </p>

						<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dalimil-hajek-facebook-1.png" alt="Dalimil Hajek - Facebook 2015+1"></span></div>
						<div class="6u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dalimil-hajek-facebook-2.png" alt="Dalimil Hajek - Facebook 2015+1 project"></span></div>
						</div><br />
						<p>
						What I eventually did was to programmatically imitate a real user signing into Facebook and posting posts by sending HTTP requests in a similar way a web browser does. Still, there were some more issues such as Facebookâ€™s spam filters or posts not showing in the correct order. These have all been dealt with. <em>Tadaaa...</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/iLEuyY9VBaU">YouTube video link</a>
